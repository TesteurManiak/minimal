# Error Handling Guidelines

<!-- Any dart file at any depth under lib/src/ -->
files: lib/src/**/*.dart

## Description
Standards for handling, logging, and displaying errors throughout the application

## Rules
- Throw errors when needed, and catch them at appropriate boundaries
- Log errors with context
- Present user-friendly error messages in the UI
- Avoid silent failures; always handle or propagate errors
