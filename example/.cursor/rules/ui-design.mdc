# UI Design Guidelines

<!-- Any dart file at any depth under a views folder at any depth -->
files: lib/src/**/views/**/*.dart

## Description
Guidelines for UI components, widget structure, and responsive design patterns

## Widget Structure
- Keep widgets focused and composable with clear responsibilities
- Flatten widget hierarchies where reasonable for better rendering performance

## Responsive Design
- Design mobile first
- Use `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` for adaptive layouts
- Centralize themes and styles in `ThemeData` for consistency
- Design for different screen sizes and orientations using responsive breakpoints

## Loading on UI
- Use a loading indicator while fetching data

## Errors on UI
- Use an error indicator with appropriate messaging for error displays
- Handle empty states gracefully in UI with clear messaging
