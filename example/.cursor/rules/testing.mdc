# Testing Guidelines

<!-- Any dart file at any depth under test/ and integration_test/ -->
files: test/**/*.dart, integration_test/**/*.dart

## Description
Standards for writing and organizing tests across different testing levels

## Unit Testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for clear and maintainable tests
- Use mocks for dependencies except for lightweight third-party services
- Test business logic in isolation from the UI

## Widget Testing
- Write widget tests for all major UI components
- Test user interactions and state changes
