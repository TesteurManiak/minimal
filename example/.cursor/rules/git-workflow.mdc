## Description
Standards for Git operations, commits, branches, and pull requests

## Git Practices
- Write atomic commits
- Do not commit files that are not related to the current feature
- When committing, write a short description of the changes you are making
- When creating a new feature, create a new branch from the `main` branch
- When merging a feature, merge the branch into the `main` branch
