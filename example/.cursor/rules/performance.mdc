# Performance Guidelines

<!-- Any dart file at any depth under lib/src/ -->
files: lib/src/**/*.dart

## Description
Best practices for optimizing application performance

## Rules
- Optimize list views with `ListView.builder`
- Optimize image handling with `cached_network_image`
- Use `const` widgets and flatten widget hierarchies for improved rendering efficiency
- Handle asynchronous operations cleanly with proper cancellation during widget disposal
- Minimize unnecessary rebuilds using memoization techniques
- Implement pagination for large data sets
